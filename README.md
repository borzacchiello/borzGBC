# BorzGBC

Gameboy Color Emulator written in Go. Multiplatform and based in SDL.

The emulator is *not* cycle-accurate, but it can still run many GB and GBC roms.

### Compilation and Usage

To compile, just run `go build` in the project directory. You need libsdl installed in your system.

To run the emulator, run:
```
$ ./borzGBC /path/to/rom
```

### Tests

To run the test suite, pull the submodule:
```
$ git submodule update --init
```

then, run the tests:
```
$ go test
```

### Keymappings
